    //  Problem: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop
    //  Solution: Iterate through the linked list, and extract the nodes into a Node array.  If any of the nodes already exist in
    //  the array, we know this is the start of the circle and return that node
    //  Time Complexity: O(n) since we are only looping through the list
    //  Space Complexity: O(n) since we are storing the input linkedList
