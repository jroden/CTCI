public class Intersection {
    //  Problem: Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect.
    //  Intersection is defined based on reference, not value
    //  Solution: Loop through both linkedLists and extract their nodes into two Node arrays (corresponding directly to each linkedList)
    //  on each node, check if the other linkedListArray contains the same node object
    //  Time Complexity: O(n) since we are only looping through the lists at most once
    //  Space Complexity: O(n) since we are storing the input linkedList and corresponding node arrays
